   obtained from imaginary-time cross-correlation functions (rather than
   autocorrelation functions) generated by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
   simulations. We show that, when processed by the filter diagonalization
   method (FDM), the same cross-correlation functions yield excited-state
   energies of higher accuracy and greater stability. The reason is that
   unlike the other methods FDM uses all the time domain information
   available. The superior performance of the cross-correlation FDM is
   demonstrated for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with closely
   lying eigenvalues. Because QMC does not take advantage of the
   separability in the Hamiltonian, this model system provides a
   challenging and generic test case.}},

abstract= {We propose an extension of the semiclassical Gaussian wave packet dynamics to eliminate the three main restrictions of this method. The first restriction is that the wave packet is forced to remain Gaussian. This is correct only for quadratic, linear, or constant potentials. The second restriction is that the method is, in general, not able to treat most classically forbidden processes. The third restriction is that the norm is conserved only for Gaussian wave packets. For a superposition of Gaussians this is no longer true. We can eliminate these restrictions by an extension of the method into complex phase space, keeping time real. J. Chem.

Abstract = {{The concept of p-orthogonality between electronic states, which
   generalizes common orthogonality and strong orthogonality, provides a
   natural hierarchy for group function methods such as the electronic
   mean field configuration interaction method. In this Letter, this
   theoretical concept is applied in numerical calculations for the first
   time. The accuracy of the geminal mean field configuration interaction
   wave functions of simple molecular systems is studied as the
   orthogonality constraint between the geminals relaxes from
   1-orthogonality (that is strong orthogonality) to 2-orthogonality, to
   no orthogonality constraint at all. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Reversible photoswitching fluorescent proteins can be photoswitched
   between fluorescent and nonfluorescent states by different irradiation
   regimes. Accumulating spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence
   Suggest a correlated change in protonation state and methine bridge
   isomerism of the chromophore. The anion can decay by photoisomerization
   of either of the methine bonds, but only one channel can act as a
   switch. Using ab initio multiple spawning dynamics Simulations, we show
   that protonation is sufficient to change the photoisomerization channel
   in the chromophore. We propose that this behavior can underlie a switch
   given certain other conditions. We also propose a basis for coupling
   between excited-state basicity changes and selection of the
   photoisomerization channel based on the polarity of twisted
   charge-transfer states for neutral and anionic forms of the chromophore.}},

Abstract = {{We study the hydrogen tunneling problem in a model system that
   represents the active site of the biological enzyme, soybean
   lipoxygenase-1. Toward this, we utilize quantum wavepacket dynamics
   performed on potential surfaces obtained by using hybrid density
   functional theory under the influence of a dynamical active site. The
   kinetic isotope effect is computed by using the transmission amplitude
   of the wavepacket, and the experimental value is reproduced. By
   computing the hydrogen nuclear orbitals (eigenstates) along the
   reaction coordinate, we note that tunneling for both hydrogen and
   deuterium occurs through the existence of distorted, spherical s-type
   proton wave functions and p-type polarized proton wave functions for
   transfer along the donor-acceptor axis. In addition, there is also a
   significant population transfer through distorted p-type proton wave
   functions directed perpendicular to the donor-acceptor axis (via
   intervening pi-type proton eigenstate interactions) which underlines
   the three-dimensional nature of the tunneling process. The quantum
   dynamical evolution indicates a significant contribution from tunneling
   processes both along the donor-acceptor axis and along directions
   perpendicular to the donor-acceptor axis. Furthermore, the tunneling
   process is facilitated by the occurrence of curve crossings and avoided
   crossings along the proton eigenstate adiabats.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology to efficiently conduct simultaneous dynamics of electrons
   and nuclei is presented. The approach involves quantum wave packet
   dynamics using an accurate banded, sparse and Toeplitz representafion
   for the discrete free propagator, in conjunction with ab initio
   molecular dynamics treatment of the electronic and classical nuclear
   degree of freedom. The latter may be achieved either by using
   atom-centered density-matrix propagation or by using Born-Oppenheimer
   dynamics. The two components of the methodology, namely, quantum
   dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, are harnessed together using
   a time-dependent self-consistent field-like coupling procedure. The
   quantum wave packet dynamics is made computationally robust by using
   adaptive grids to achieve optimized sampling. One notable feature of
   the approach is that important quantum dynamical effects including,
   zero-point effects, tunneling, as well as over-barrier reflections are
   treated accurately. The electronic degrees of freedom are
   simultaneously handled at accurate levels of density functional theory,
   including hybrid or gradient corrected approximations. Benchmark
   calculations are provided for. proton transfer systems and the dynamics
   results are compared with exact calculations to determine the accuracy
   of the approach. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}}

Abstract = {{The reaction of O(P-3) with HCl at hyperthermal collision energies
   (45-116 kcal mol(-1)) has been investigated with crossed-molecular
   beams experiments and direct dynamics quasi-classical trajectory
   calculations. The reaction may proceed by two primary pathways, (I)
   H-atom abstraction to produce OH and Cl and (2) H-atom elimination to
   produce H and ClO. The H-atom abstraction reaction follows a stripping
   mechanism, in which the reagent O atom approaches the HCl molecule at
   large impact parameters and the OH product is scattered in the forward
   direction, defined as the initial direction of the reagent O atoms. The
   H-atom elimination reaction is highly endoergic and requires
   low-impact-parameter collisions. The excitation function for ClO
   increases from a threshold near 45 kcal moll to a maximum around 115
   kcal mol(-1) and then begins to decrease when the ClO product can be
   formed with sufficient internal energy to undergo secondary
   dissociation. At collision energies slightly above threshold for H-atom
   elimination, the ClO product scatters primarily in the backward
   direction, but as the collision energy increases, the fraction of these
   products that scatter in the forward and sideways directions increases.
   The dependence of the angular distribution of ClO on collision energy
   is a result of the differences in collision geometry. Collisions where
   the H atom on HCl is oriented away from the incoming reagent O atom
   lead to backward-scattered ClO and those where the H atom is oriented
   toward the incoming O atom lead to forward-scattered ClO. The latter
   trajectories do not follow the minimum energy path and involve larger
   translational energy release. Therefore, they become dominant at higher
   collision energies because they lead to lower internal energies and
   more stable ClO products. The H-atom abstraction and elimination
   reactions have comparable cross sections for hyperthermal O(P-3) + HCl
   collisions.}}

   Computational Quantum Chemistry concentrating on Medicinal Chemistry
   projects was developed for undergraduate and graduate students. The
   results showed that students got more motivated and involved when there
   is an articulation between theory and practice. This work presents an
   alternative way to teach Theoretical Chemistry using projects.}},

   saddle points that connect these minima. While low-resolution spectra
   of CH5+ have been assigned, the nature of the couplings between the CH
   stretches and the low-frequency modes is not as well characterized. An
   understanding of this will be important in the interpretation of
   rotationally resolved spectra. In this work, fixed-node diffusion Monte
   Carlo techniques are used to calculate energies and probability
   amplitudes for several excited states. The calculated energies are
   shown to be in good agreement with previously reported vibrational
   configuration interactions calculations. Analysis of the 12-dimensional

   normal mode analysis is done for the methyl products to determine the
   classical actions of each normal mode and then standard histogram
   binning and Gaussian binning (GB) methods are employed to obtain
   quantum state-resolved probabilities of the products. QCT calculations
   have been performed for both the vibrationally ground state and the CH
   stretching excited F+CHD3(v(1)=0,1) reactions at eight different
   collision energies in the 0.5-7.0 kcal/mol range. HF and DF
   vibrationally state-resolved rotational and angular distributions, CD3
   and CHD2 mode-specific vibrational distributions, and correlated
   vibrationally state-specific distributions for the product pairs have
   been obtained and the correlated results were compared to the

   in the threshold regions. The CH stretching excitation in the reactant
   does not change the CD3 vibrational distributions significantly,
   whereas the HF molecules become vibrationally and rotationally hotter.
   On the other hand in the case of the DF+CHD2 channel the initially
   excited CH stretch appears mainly ``intact{''} in the CHD2 product and
   the DF distributions are virtually the same as formed from the ground
   state CHD3 reaction. The computed results qualitatively agree with
   recent crossed molecular beam experiment {[}W. Zhang , Science 325, 303
   (2009)] that (a) CHD2(v(1)=1) is the most populated product state of
   the F+CHD3(v(1)=1) reaction and this reaction produces much less
   CHD2(v=0) compared to the reaction F+CHD3(v=0); (b) the cross section
   ratio of CHD2(v(1)=1):CHD2(v=0) formed from the reactions
   F+CHD3(v(1)=1):F+CHD3(v=0) is less than 1 and shows little collision
   energy dependency; (c) the reactant CH stretch excitation increases the
   DF:HF ratio at low collision energies; (d) the correlated vibrational
   and angular distributions for DF(v)+CHD2(v(1)=0,1) from the ground

   methods including CCSD(T), QCISD, CBS-QCI/APNO, CBS-QB3, G2M(CC, MP2),
   DFT-B3LYP and CASSCF. An efficient reaction pathway on the
   electronically excited (3)A' surface resulting in H(S-2) + HCCO(A(2)A')
   was newly identified and is predicted to play an important role at
   higher temperatures. The primary product distribution for the
   multistate multiwell reaction was then determined by RRKM statistical
   rate theory and weak-collision master equation analysis using the exact
   stochastic simulation method. Allowing for nonstatistical behavior of
   the internal rotation mode of the initial (3)A'' adducts, our computed

Abstract = {{A Born-Oppenheimer direct dynamics simulation of the O+ + CH4 reaction
   dynamics at hyperthermal energies has been carried out with the PM3
   (ground quartet state) Hamiltonian. Calculations were performed at
   various collision energies ranging from 0.5 to 10 eV with emphasis on
   high energy collisions where this reaction is relevant to materials
   erosion studies in low Earth orbit and geosynchronous Earth orbit.
   Charge transfer to give CH4+ is the dominant channel arising from O+ +
   CH4 collisions in this energy range, but most of the emphasis in our
   study is on collisions that lead to reaction. All energetically
   accessible reaction channels were found, including products containing
   carbon-oxygen bonds, which is in agreement with the results of recent
   experiments. After correcting for compensating errors in competing
   reaction channels, our excitation functions show quantitative agreement
   with experiment (for which absolute magnitudes of cross sections are
   available) at high collision energies (several eV). More detailed
   properties, such as translational and angular distributions, show
   qualitative agreement. The opacity function reveals a high selectivity
   for producing OH+ at high impact parameters, CH3+/CH2+/H2O+ at
   intermediate impact parameters, and H2CO+/HCO+/CO+ at small impact
   parameters. Angular distributions for CH3+/CH2+/OH+ are forward
   scattered at high collision energies which implies the importance of
   direct reaction mechanisms, while reaction complexes play an important
   role at lower energies, especially for the H2O+ product. Finally, we
   find that the nominally spin-forbidden product CH3+ + OH can be
   produced by a spin-allowed pathway that involves the formation of the
   triplet excited product CH3+ ((a) over tilde E-3). This explains why
   CH3+ can have a high cross section, even at very low collision
   energies. The results of this work suggest that the PM3 method may be
   applied directly to the study of O+ reactions with small alkane
   molecules and polymer surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the impact of vibrational excitation on molecular

   should have little impact on the outcome. We report here an in-depth
   experimental study of the reactivity effects exerted by reactant C-H
   stretching excitation in a prototypical early-barrier reaction, F +
   CHD3. Rather counterintuitively, we find that the vibration hinders the
   overall reaction rate, inhibits scission of the excited bond itself
   (favoring the DF + CHD2 product channel), and influences the coproduct
   vibrational distribution despite being conserved in the CHD2 product.
   The results highlight substantial gaps in our predictive framework for

   (LSC-IVR) methods are compared and contrasted in a study of the

   this water model, a RPMD simulation gives a diffusion coefficient that
   is only a few percent larger than the classical diffusion coefficient,
   whereas a LSC-IVR simulation gives a diffusion coefficient that is
   three times larger. We attribute this discrepancy to the unphysical
   leakage of initially quantized zero point energy (ZPE) from the
   intramolecular to the intermolecular modes of the liquid as the LSC-IVR
   simulation progresses. In spite of this problem, which is avoided by
   construction in RPMD, the LSC-IVR may still provide a useful
   approximation to certain short-time dynamical properties which are not
   so strongly affected by the ZPE leakage. We illustrate this with an
   application to the liquid water dipole absorption spectrum, for which
   the RPMD approximation breaks down at frequencies in the O-H stretching
   region owing to contamination from the internal modes of the ring
   polymer. The LSC-IVR does not suffer from this difficulty and it

   are slightly violated. Therefore, we use the SHAKE-methodology to
   enforce the constraints after each minimization step. We have extended
   theta -SHAKE for bend angles and introduce phi -SHAKE and chi -SHAKE to
   constrain dihedral and out-of-plane angles, respectively. Two case
   studies are presented: (1) A mode analysis of united-atom n-butane with
   various internal degrees of freedom kept frozen and (2) the
   minimization of chromene at a fixed approach toward the catalytic site

Abstract = {{The variational Gaussian wavepacket (VGW) method in combination with
   the replica-exchange Monte Carlo is applied to calculations of the heat
   capacities of quantum water clusters, (H2O)(8) and (H2O)(10). The VGW
   method is most conveniently formulated in Cartesian coordinates. These
   in turn require the use of a flexible (i.e., unconstrained) water
   potential. When the latter is fitted as a linear combination of
   Gaussians, all the terms involved in the numerical solution of the VGW
   equations of motion are analytic. When a flexible water model is used,
   a large difference in the timescales of the inter- and intramolecular
   degrees of freedom generally makes the system very difficult to
   simulate numerically. Yet, given this difficulty, we demonstrate that
   our methodology is still practical. We compare the computed heat
   capacities to those for the corresponding classical systems. As
   expected, the quantum effects shift the melting temperatures toward the
   lower values. }}

Abstract = {{Semiclassical Gaussian approximations to the Boltzmann operator have
   become an important tool for the investigation of thermodynamic
   properties of clusters of atoms at low temperatures. Usually,
   numerically expensive thawed Gaussian variants are applied. In this
   article, we introduce a numerically much cheaper frozen Gaussian
   approximation to the imaginary time propagator with a width matrix
   especially suited for the dynamics of clusters. The quality of the
   results is comparable to that of thawed Gaussian methods based on the
   single-particle ansatz. We apply the method to the argon trimer and
   investigate the dissociation process of the cluster. The results
   clearly show a classical-like transition from a bounded moiety to three
   free particles at a temperature T approximate to 20 K, whereas previous
   studies of the system were not able to resolve this transition. Quantum
   effects, i.e., differences with the purely classical case manifest
   themselves in the low-temperature behavior of the mean energy and
   specific heat as well as in a slight shift of the transition
   temperature. We also discuss the influence of an artificial confinement
   of the atoms usually introduced to converge numerical computations. The
   results show that restrictive confinements often implemented in studies
   of clusters can influence the thermodynamic properties drastically.
   This finding may have implications on other studies of atomic clusters.}}

OPTAbstract = {{The dynamics of two coupled oscillators can become quite complex if
   anharmonic potential energy functions are employed. This type of system
   therefore represents a good model for an investigation of the
   performance of mixed quantum-classical methods. In this work, the motion
   of two coupled particles with a mass ratio of one to ten is studied with
   three different mixed quantum-classical methods in the presence of
   anharmonic potential terms for a comparison with exact quantum
   mechanical calculations. The mixed quantum-classical approaches include
   the multitrajectory Ehrenfest, the mixed quantum-classical Bohmian
   (MQCB), and the so-called coupled Schrodinger equations (CSE)
   formalisms. The analysis shows that while the description of a weakly
   anharmonic system by the Ehrenfest and MQCB schemes is accurate if
   proper sampling techniques are applied, both approximations break down
   rapidly if the anharmonic terms are increased. The performance of the
   simple CSE prescription, which corresponds to a reduction of the full
   two-dimensional wave function to two one-dimensional wave functions
   representing two quantum oscillators coupled via the potential energy in
   a classical fashion, decreases if the width of the initial wave packet
   is enlarged. The dependence of the CSE method on the diffuseness of the
   initial wave packet is therefore opposite to that of the MQCB method,
   which is more accurate for wide wave packets. Overall, the
   multitrajectory Ehrenfest ansatz is found to be most successful in
   reproducing the exact quantum results. (c) 2006 American Institute of

A generalized iterative finite difference method (IFDM) is used to solve the resulting set of non-linear coupled equations. The IFDM is 2nd-order accurate in both space and time and exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the iteration count. The stability and computational efficiency of the IFDM is significantly improved by using a “smart” Eulerian grid which has the same computational advantages as a Lagrangian or Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) grid. The IFDM is generalized to treat higher-dimensional problems and anharmonic potentials. The method is applied to a one-dimensional Gaussian wave packet scattering from an Eckart barrier, a one-dimensional Morse oscillator, and a two-dimensional (2D) model collinear reaction using an anharmonic potential energy surface. The 2D scattering results represent the first successful application of an accurate direct numerical solution of the quantum hydrodynamic equations to an anharmonic potential energy surface. }

abstract = {The possible existence of a complex-forming pathway for the H+O(2) reaction has been investigated by means of both quantum mechanical and statistical techniques. Reaction probabilities, integral cross sections, and differential cross sections have been obtained with a statistical quantum method and the mean potential phase space theory. The statistical predictions are compared to exact results calculated by means of time dependent wave packet methods and a previously reported time independent exact quantum mechanical approach using the double many-body expansion (DMBE IV) potential energy surface (PES) [Pastrana et al., J. Phys. Chem. 94, 8073 (1990)] and the recently developed surface (denoted XXZLG) by Xu et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 244305 (2005)]. The statistical approaches are found to reproduce only some of the exact total reaction probabilities for low total angular momenta obtained with the DMBE IV PES and some of the cross sections calculated at energy values close to the reaction threshold for the XXZLG surface. Serious discrepancies with the exact integral cross sections at higher energy put into question the possible statistical nature of the title reaction. However, at a collision energy of 1.6 eV, statistical rotationally resolved cross sections managed to reproduce the experimental cross sections for the H+O(2)(v=0,j=1)-->OH(v(')=1,j('))+O process reasonably well.},

abstract = {On a new potential energy surface (PES-2008) developed by our group (preceding paper), we performed an extensive kinetics study using variational transition-state theory with semiclassical transmission coefficients over a wide temperature range of 250-2000 K and a dynamics study using quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) and quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations at collision energies between 0.7 and 2.0 eV for the title reaction and isotopically substituted versions. Kinetically, the H + CH(4) forward and reverse thermal rate constants reproduce the available experimental data, with a small curvature of the Arrhenius plot indicating the role of tunneling in this hydrogen abstraction reaction. Five sets of kinetic isotope effects are also calculated. In general, they reproduce the experimental information. Dynamically, we focused on the H + CD(4) reaction because there are more experimental studies for comparison. Most of the available energy appears as product translational energy (55\%-68\%), with the HD product being vibrationally cold (v(')=0,1) in agreement with experiment, although rotationally hotter than experiment. The reaction cross section is practically negligible at 0.7 eV and still small at 1.5 eV, reproducing the experimental evidence, although our values are smaller. The product angular distribution is analyzed using QCT and QM methods. While at low energies (0.7 eV) both the QCT and the QM calculations yield forward scattered CD(3) product, i.e., a rebound mechanism, at high energy (1.2 eV) only the QM calculations reproduce the experiment. The agreement with this wide variety of kinetic and dynamic experimental data (always qualitative and in some cases quantitative) shows the capacity of the PES-2008 surface to describe the reaction system.},

The method is based on a numerically cheap linearized quantum force approach; stabilizing terms compensating for the linearization errors are added into the time-evolution equations for the classical and nonclassical components of the momentum operator. The wave function normalization and energy are rigorously conserved. Numerical tests are performed for model systems of up to 40 degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {The O(3P,1D) + H2 --> OH + H reaction is studied using trajectory dynamics within the approximate quantum potential approach. Calculations of the wave-packet reaction probabilities are performed for four coupled electronic states for total angular momentum J = 0 using a mixed coordinate/polar representation of the wave function. Semiclassical dynamics is based on a single set of trajectories evolving on an effective potential-energy surface and in the presence of the approximate quantum potential. Population functions associated with each trajectory are computed for each electronic state. The effective surface is a linear combination of the electronic states with the contributions of individual components defined by their time-dependent average populations. The wave-packet reaction probabilities are in good agreement with the quantum-mechanical results. Intersystem crossing is found to have negligible effect on reaction probabilities summed over final electronic states.},

abstract = {The variational Gaussian wavepacket (VGW) approximation provides an alternative to path integral Monte Carlo for the computation of thermodynamic properties of many-body systems at thermal equilibrium. It provides a direct access to the thermal density matrix and is particularly efficient for Monte Carlo approaches, as for an N-body system it operates in a non-inflated 3N-dimensional configuration space. Here, we greatly accelerate the VGW method by retaining only the relevant short-range correlations in the (otherwise full) 3N × 3N Gaussian width matrix without sacrificing the accuracy of the fully coupled VGW method. This results in the reduction of the original O(N(3)) scaling to O(N(2)). The fast-VGW method is then applied to quantum Lennard-Jones clusters with sizes up to N = 6500 atoms. Following Doye and Calvo [JCP 116, 8307 (2002)] we study the competition between the icosahedral and decahedral structural motifs in Ne(N) clusters as a function of N.},

The dynamics of the reaction is extensively studied at the collision energy of E(coll)=0.44 eV. Integral and differential cross sections and opacity functions at this collision energy have been calculated. In particular, the fairly good description of the exact quantum results provided by the statistical quantum method suggests that the dynamics of the process is governed by an insertion mechanism with the formation of a long-lived collision complex.},

abstract = {Ab initio potential energy surfaces and the corresponding analytical energy functions of the ground 1A' and excited 2A' states for the Li(2(2)P) plus H(2) reaction are constructed. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations on the fitted energy functions are performed to characterize the reactions of Li(2(2)P) with H(2)(v = 0, j = 1) and H(2)(v = 1, j = 1) as well as the reaction when the vibrational energy is replaced by collision energy. For simplicity, the transition probability is assumed to be unity when the trajectories go through the crossing seam region and change to the lower surface. The calculated rotational distributions of LiH(v = 0) for both H(2)(v = 0, j = 1) and H(2)(v = 1, j = 1) reactions are single-peaked with the maximum population at j' = 7, consistent with the previous observation. The vibrational excitation of H(2)(v = 1) may enhance the reaction cross section of LiH(v' = 0) by about 200 times, as compared to a result of 93-107 reported in the experimental measurements. In contrast, the enhancement is 3.1, if the same amount of energy is deposited in the translational states. This endothermic reaction can be considered as an analog of late barrier. According to the trajectory analysis, the vibrational excitation enlarges the H-H distance in the entrance channel to facilitate the reaction, but the excess energy may not open up additional reaction configuration.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the reactions of hydrogen atoms with methane and ethane molecules and isotopomers. High-accuracy electronic-structure calculations have been carried out to characterize representative regions of the potential-energy surface (PES) of various reaction pathways, including H abstraction and H exchange. These ab initio calculations have been subsequently employed to derive an improved set of parameters for the modified symmetrically-orthogonalized intermediate neglect of differential overlap (MSINDO) semiempirical Hamiltonian, which are specific to the H+alkane family of reactions. The specific-reaction-parameter (SRP) Hamiltonian has then been used to perform a quasiclassical-trajectory study of both the H+CH4 and H+C2H6 reactions. The calculated values of dynamics properties of the H+CH4-->H2+CH3 reaction and isotopologues, including alkyl product speed distributions, diatomic product internal-state distributions, and cross sections, are generally in good agreement with experiment and with the results provided by the ZBB3 PES [Z. Xie et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 133120 (2006)]. The results of trajectories propagated with the SRP Hamiltonian for the H+C2H6-->H2+C2H5 reaction also agree with experiment. The level of agreement between the results calculated with the SRP Hamiltonian and experiment in both the H+methane and H+ethane reactions indicates that semiempirical Hamiltonians can be improved for not only a specific reaction but also a family of reactions.},

The approach (equilibrium Liouville dynamics) is in the spirit of Liouville's theorem in classical mechanics. The trajectory-based dynamics is able to conserve the quantum canonical distribution for the thermal equilibrium system and approaches classical dynamics in the classical (ℏ → 0), high temperature ($\beta$ → 0), and harmonic limits. Equilibrium Liouville dynamics provides the framework for the development of novel theoretical∕computational tools for studying quantum dynamical effects in large∕complex molecular systems.},

abstract = {In the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics the time-dependent Schrodinger equation is solved in terms of quantum trajectories evolving under the influence of quantum and classical potentials. For a practical implementation that scales favorably with system size and is accurate for semiclassical systems, we use approximate quantum potentials. Recently, we have shown that optimization of the nonclassical component of the momentum operator in terms of fitting functions leads to the energy-conserving approximate quantum potential. In particular, linear fitting functions give the exact time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet in a locally quadratic potential and can describe the dominant quantum-mechanical effects in the semiclassical scattering problems of nuclear dynamics. In this paper we formulate the Bohmian dynamics on subspaces and define the energy-conserving approximate quantum potential in terms of optimized nonclassical momentum, extended to include the domain boundary functions. This generalization allows a better description of the non-Gaussian wave packets and general potentials in terms of simple fitting functions. The optimization is performed independently for each domain and each dimension. For linear fitting functions optimal parameters are expressed in terms of the first and second moments of the trajectory distribution. Examples are given for one-dimensional anharmonic systems and for the collinear hydrogen exchange reaction.},

abstract = {The quantum trajectory approach is generalized to arbitrary coordinate systems, including curvilinear coordinates. This allows one to perform an approximate quantum trajectory propagation, which scales favorably with system size, in the same framework as standard quantum wave packet dynamics. The trajectory formulation is implemented in Jacobi coordinates for a nonrotating triatomic molecule. Wave packet reaction probabilities are computed for the O(3P) + H2 --> OH + H reaction using the approximate quantum potential. The latter is defined by the nonclassical component of the momentum operator expanded in terms of linear and exponential functions. Unlike earlier implementations with linear functions, the introduction of the exponential function provides an accurate description of asymptotic dynamics for this system and gives good agreement of approximate reaction probabilities with accurate quantum calculations.},

@article{Sun2004,
abstract = {Direct dynamics classical trajectory simulations were performed to study product energy partitioning in C(2)H(5)F-->C(2)H(4)+HF dissociation. The intrinsic reaction coordinate potential energy curve, reaction energetics, and transition state (TS) properties were calculated for this reaction at different levels of electronic structure theory, and MP2/6-31G( *) was chosen as a meaningful and practical method for performing the direct dynamics. The trajectories show that the HF bond, uncoupled from the other degrees of freedom, is formed within the first 10 fs as the system moves from the TS towards products. The populations of the HF vibration states, determined from the simulations, decrease monotonically as found from experiments. However, the simulation's populations for the low and high energy vibration states are larger and smaller, respectively, than the experimental results. The HF rotational temperature found from the simulations is in agreement with experiment. Increasing the TS's excess energy gives higher rotational temperatures for both C(2)H(4) and HF. Energy is partitioned to the products from both the excess energy in the TS and the potential energy release in the exit channel. Partitioning from these two energy sources is distinguished by varying the TS's excess energy. An analysis of the simulation's energy disposal shows that the fractions of the excess energy partitioned to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration, C(2)H(4) rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation, are 0.17, 0.64, 0.076, 0.067, and 0.046, respectively, and are in good agreement with previous simulations on empirical potentials and experiments. The partitioning found for the potential energy release is 81\%, <0.05\%, 5\%, 11\%, and 3\% to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration, C(2)H(4) rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. This result is substantially different than the deduction from experiments, which summarizes the partitioning as 20\%, 45\%, 24\%, and <12\% to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration+rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. Possible origins of the difference between the simulations and experiments in the release of the potential energy is discussed.},

abstract = {The efficiency of the numerical propagators for solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the wave packet approach to reactive scattering is of vital importance. In this Perspective, we first briefly review the propagators used in quantum reactive scattering calculations and their applications to triatomic reactions. Then we present a detailed comparison of about thirty higher-order split operator propagators for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with their applications to the wave packet evolution within a one-dimensional Morse potential, and the total reaction probability calculations for the H + HD, H + NH, H + O(2), and F + HD reactions. These four triatomic reactions have quite different dynamic characteristics and thus provide a comprehensive picture of the relative advantages of these higher-order propagation methods for describing reactive scattering dynamics. Our calculations reveal that the most often used second-order split operator method is typically more efficient for a direct reaction, particularly for those involving flat potential energy surfaces. However, the optimal higher-order split operator methods are more suitable for a reaction with resonances and intermediate complexes or a reaction experiencing potential energy surface with fluctuations of considerable amplitude. Three 4th-order and one 6th-order split operator methods, which are most efficient for solving reactive scattering in various conditions among the tested ones, are recommended for general applications. In addition, a brief discussion on the relative performance between the Chebyshev real wave packet method and the split operator method is given. The results in this Perspective are expected to stimulate more applications of (high-order) split operators to the quantum reactive scattering calculation and other related problems.},
